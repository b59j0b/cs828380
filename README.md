In this writing assignment, you will analyze racial disparities in a data set about judge overrides in Alabama. These data have been slightly modified for educational purposes on this assignment but are based on real data. These judge overrides occur when a jury sentences a defendant to life in prison, but the judge did not follow their ruling and instead sentenced the defendant to the death penalty. Alabama is the only state that has regularly overridden jury decisions of life in prison in favor of the death penalty. It was also the last state to abolish this practice, ending it only in 2017. However, defendants in cases that were decided before 2017 may still face the death penalty in Alabama after the ruling. You can learn more about judge overrides in Alabama from the Equal Justice Initiative at this link: https://eji.org/reports/judge-override/.
Steps: 
1.   (a) Download the provided Excel data set. What percent of total cases involve a Black defendant? A White defendant?
(b) What percent of overridden   cases involve a Black defendant? A White Defendant?
You can do these by hand or use the “COUNTIFS” function in Excel or any statistical software of your choice.
2.   Are the differences you found in Step 1 between the total percentage of cases involving Black defendants and the percentage of overridden cases involving Black defendants sufficient to conclude that judges have racial bias? Explain your answers. (Suggested word count: 200).
3.   Sort the data by judge. Find:
(a)   A judge that you think exhibits evidence consistent with racial bias against Black or White defendants.
(b)   A judge that is more lenient but unbiased.
(c)   A judge that is more stringent but unbiased.
Explain each of your answers. (Suggested word count: 300 words).
4.   (a) What percent of cases overseen by Black judges involve Black defendants? 
(b)   What percent of overridden cases overseen by Black judges involve Black defendants?
(c)   What percent of cases overseen by White judges involve Black defendants?
(d)   What percent of overridden cases overseen by White judges involve Black defendants?

5.   Are your findings from Step 4 more consistent with statistical discrimination or taste-based discrimination? Use an argument in the style. of Antonovics and Knight (2009) to justify your answer. (Suggested word count: 300 words).
